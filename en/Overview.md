## Security > NHN AppGuard > Overview

NHN AppGuard helps prevent manipulating application codes. It also detects and prohibits any tools which try to manipulate memory, speed or codes through patterned or heuristic method.

## Feature/Advantage

* Blocks code manipulation from the root stage.
* Detects and prohibits various fabricating tools through pattern- or act-oriented method.
* Checks information detected by NHN AppGuard through Console so as to provide cause for restriction.
* Protects application with easy but strong means
* Currently in use for about 100 services, including game, shopping, and simple payment, to serve as a protective measure against abusive acts or application manipulation.

## Main Features

Functions are provided as follows:

* Easily blocks decompiling by protecting applications through web consoles
* Detects manipulated applications by checking integrity of files
* Detects abusive acts, such as rooting or emulation.
* Detects speed hack.
* Detects by pattern or act of each manipulative tool.
* Provides low-cost automatic sanctions, unlike resource-wasting manual system (to be updated soon)

| Term       | Description                                                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heuristic Detection  | A method of general detection on cheating tools which prevents taking a bypass                               |
| Code Manipulation    | A manipulative act by analyzing code decompiling to gain profits                              |
| Decompile     | An act of converting compiled codes to high-level language for easy analysis                                       |
| File integrity   | An act of checking if original files are changed due to code manipulation                                     |
| Rooting, Jail Break   | Upgrading smartphone user’s restricted authority to the highest root level so as to gain access to all system parts without a hitch |
| Behavior Based Detection | A method of detection by copying how a cheating tool does to cheat                                   |
| System Restriction   | Sanctions on detected logs automatically posed by a system, not by an operator’s manual act                   |

## Service Structure

Figure 1 displays how NHN AppGuard works:
Using NHN AppGuard’s SDK, the code is integrated with the application (optional), and then app protection service (required) is completed and deployed on a console or Command Line Interface (CLI). The NHN AppGuard Engine sends a detective log to a server so as to block or sanction against abuses.
