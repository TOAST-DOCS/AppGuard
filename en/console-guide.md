NHN AppGuard supports Android, iOS, and Unity environments.

### Android

### iOS

* You can apply the AppGuard iOS SDK to protect your app (required).
* You can protect your app more conveniently through the web console or CLI from ipa files built in Xcode (optional).
* You must perform protection actions using the web console or CLI to enable features such as integrity verification, signer verification, default policy, obfuscation, and plan selection.
* If you don't protect your app through the web console or CLI, it runs on the Business plan.

### Unity

* You can easily protect Android/iOS apps through provided features.
* The Unity SDK includes an Android SDK and an iOS SDK and can be applied through a single interface.
