## Security > AppGuard > Console Guide

AppGuard is provided in two versions: Android and iOS(Beta).

For Android users, AppGuard is applied when apk files built on SDK integration (optional) go through application protection process (required) on a web console or command line interface(CLI).
For iOS users, it is applied when the application files are created with SDK integration (required) and no further protection process is required.

Following diagram shows the AppGuard application process.

## Dashboard
When an abusive user is detected, you can check detection status by clicking on the **Dashboard** tab.

![appguard_01_201812_en](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_appguard/appguard_01_201812_en.png)

- **Status of abnormal behavior** can be found among abusive users as detected by AppGuard in the order of trials by **log detection pattern** or **period**.
- Click **Download Reports (CSV)** on top-right of the page to download the detection result of abnormal behavior.  
- **Dashboard** tab shows statistical graphs and the list of abusive users detected by AppGuard.
	- For rooting, you may check detection or sanction logs on dashboard, once a day since app is installed.
- You can **Search** by [User ID], [Device ID], [Detection Log Count], [Log Pattern], and [Search Period].
	- Multiple [User ID] and [Device ID] can be added with comma as a delimiter.
- In the statistical detection graph, you can check 'Detection Distribution by Pattern' and 'Change status of detection logs'.
- The detection list shows User ID, Device ID, Host IP, OS, Logs, App Information, and Detection Time.
- You may click **Download Report (CSV)** to download the query result.

## App Protection

### Download and Integrate SDKs

Select **App Protection** and click **Download SDK** to download SDK by OS.

Then, follow the attached manual to work with SDKs.
(In case of iOS, no further steps are required once the applicaiton is integrated with the SDK).

### App Protection Menu

Select **App Protection** and click **+ Protect App**.

- Select the name of [Alias].
- Enter [Alias Password].
- Choose an [APK]
- Select the level of protection
	- Level1 : Basic level of pattern-oriented and abnormal acts protection on application
	- Level2 : Level1 + Advanced security functions such as, code encryption and preventing app manipulation (Recommended for general apps)
	- Level3 : Level2 + Fortified security functions (Recommended for game apps)
	- Level ex : This level requires SDK integration, which provides security between Level 1 and Level 2 (recommended only when there's a conflict with other security solutions)
- Click **Ok** to start Protect App
    - When completed, you can download the protected application. Now, you're ready to upload protected apps on each Appstore for deployment.
