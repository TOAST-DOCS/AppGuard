## Security > AppGuard > Getting Started

AppGuard is provided in two versions: Android and iOS(Beta).

For Android users, AppGuard is applied when apk files built on SDK integration (optional) go through application protection process (required) on a web console or command line interface(CLI).
For iOS users, it is applied when apk files are created with SDK integration (required) and no further protection process is needed.

Apply step for using AppGuard are shown in [Figure 1].
